tidyjson provides tools for turning [json](http://www.json.org/) into [tidy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html)
data.

## Installation

Get the released version from CRAN:

```R
install.packages("tidyjson")
```

or the development version from github:

```R
devtools::install_github("jeremystan/tidyjson")
```

## Examples

The following example takes a character vector of 
`r library(tidyjson);length(worldbank)` 
documents in the `worldbank` dataset and spreads out all objects into new 
columns

```{r}
library(tidyjson)
library(dplyr)

worldbank %>% spread_all %>% tbl_df
```

However, some objects in `worldbank` are arrays, this example shows how
to quickly summarize the top level structure of a JSON collection

```{r}
worldbank %>% gather_keys %>% json_types %>% count(key, type)
```

In order to capture the data in `majorsector_percent` we can use `enter_object` 
to enter into that object, `gather_array` to stack the array and `spread_all`
to capture the object keys under the array.

```{r}
worldbank %>%
  enter_object("majorsector_percent") %>%
  gather_array %>%
  spread_all %>%
  tbl_df
```

## API

### Spreading objects into columns

* `spread_all()` for spreading all object values into new columns, with nested
objects having column names with concatenated keys

* `spread_values()` for specifying a subset of object values to spread into
new columns using the `jstring()`, `jnumber()` and `jlogical()` functions

### Object navigation

* `enter_object()` for entering into an object by name, discarding all other
JSON (and rows without the corresponding object key) and allowing further 
operations on the object value

* `gather_keys()` for stacking all object values by key name, expanding the
rows of the `tbl_json` object accordingly

### Array navigation

* `gather_array()` for stacking all array values by index, expanding the
rows of the `tbl_json` object accordingly

### JSON inspection

* `json_types()` for identifying JSON data types

* `json_length()` for computing the length of JSON data (can be larger than
`1` for objects and arrays)

* `json_complexity()` for computing the length of the unnested JSON, i.e.,
how many terminal leaves there are in a complex JSON structure

### JSON summarization

* `json_structure()` for creating a single fixed column data.frame that 
recursively structures arbitrary JSON data

* `json_schema()` for representing the schema of complex JSON, unioned across
disparate JSON documents, and collapsing arrays to their most complex type
representation

### JSON plotting

* `plot_json_graph()` for plotting JSON (or `json_schema()`) as a graph using
the `igraph` package

### Creating tbl_json objects

* `as.tbl_json()` for converting a string or character vector into a `tbl_json`
object, or for converting a `data.frame` with a JSON column using the
`json.column` argument

* `tbl_json()` for combining a `data.frame` and associated `list` derived
from JSON data into a `tbl_json` object

* `read_json()` for reading JSON data from a file

### Included JSON data

* `commits`: commit data for the dplyr repo from github API

* `issues`: issue data for the dplyr repo from github API

* `worldbank`: world bank funded projects from 
[jsonstudio](http://jsonstudio.com/resources/)

* `companies`: startup company data from 
[jsonstudio](http://jsonstudio.com/resources/)

## Philosophy

The goal is to turn complex JSON data, which is often represented as nested
lists, into tidy data frames that can be more easily manipulated.

* Work on a single JSON document, or on a collection of related documents
(where the schema of each document may vary)
* Perform complex JSON manipulation using the pipe, `%>%`, producing code that
can be read from left to right
* Guarantee the structure of the data produced, even if the input JSON
structure changes (the exception being `spread_all`, which produces new
columns based on the input JSON alone)
* Allow for structuring in tidy form arbitrarily nested (arrays or objects) JSON
Naturally handle 'ragged' arrays and / or objects (varying lengths by document)
* Allow for extraction of data in values or key names
* Ensure edge cases are handled correctly (especially empty data)
* Integrate seamlessly with `dplyr`, allowing `tbl_json` objects to pipe into
`dplyr` verbs, and (when reasonable) back into further `tidyjson` verbs

## Related Work

Tidyjson depends upon

* [magrritr](https://github.com/smbache/magrittr) for the `%>%` pipe operator
* [jsonlite](https://github.com/jeroenooms/jsonlite) for converting JSON strings into nested lists
* [purrr](https://github.com/hadley/purrr) for list operators
* [tidyr](https://github.com/hadley/tidyr) for unnesting and spreading

Further, there are other R packages that can be used to better understand
JSON data

* [listviewer](https://github.com/timelyportfolio/listviewer) for viewing JSON data interactively
